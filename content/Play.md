## Prerequisites

### [**Mod your switch**](https://switch.hacks.guide/)

### Check SMO Version

Before doing anything, check what version of *Super Mario Odyssey* you have installed.
To do this, press :s-icon{name="plus"} on the game on the home screen and pull up its properties.
If you're already on version `1.0.0`, you can skip the downgrading process and move to Installing SMOO.
If you're on ***any other version***, you'll need to use the **Odyssey Downgrader**.

::::row
:::::c-card{description="Ready"}
![Good version](/img/smo_v1.png)
> You're on `1.0.0`
:::::
:::::c-card{description="Not Ready"}
![Bad version](/img/smo_vX.png)
> You're **not** on `1.0.0`
:::::
::::

### Downgrade SMO

::::alert{type="info"}
[Skip this](#installing-smoo) if you are already on version `1.0.0`
::::

If you are on a version *other* than `1.0.0`, you will need to downgrade your game.
We recommend you use the [Odyssey Downgrader](https://github.com/Istador/odyssey-downgrade/releases),
which should apply SMO version `1.0.0` to your game as a mod. This is necessary for a lot of mods to work.

::::alert{type="warning"}
*Many* issues stem from not upgrading your copy of the [*Odyssey Downgrader*](https://github.com/Istador/odyssey-downgrade/releases) or [*LockpickRCM*](https://www.google.com/search?q=lockpick_rcm+latest+version).
If you're having trouble downgrading SMO, try updating both.
::::

To get started, make sure:

- You have the cartridge or digital version inserted.
- You have dumped your Switch keys using [Lockpick RCM](https://www.google.com/search?q=lockpick_rcm+latest+version).

:separator{label="Once everything is setup..."}

- Place the [Odyssey Downgrader](https://github.com/Istador/odyssey-downgrade/releases) in the `switch` folder in the root of your sd card.
- Launch into your CFW.
- Open the **hbmenu** in screenshots :s-icon{name="screenshot"} .
- Launch `Odyssey Downgrade`:

> This will take 5.2 GB of space on your sd card since it applies as a mod.

> If SMO crashes on launch please remove & reinsert the cartridge & try again.
